# Algorithm Efficiency Comparison

This is an Experiment between Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Shell Sort and Insertion Sort, to find out which one of them is the most effective.

## Experiments

Input arrays will have the sizes of 2^7, 2^8, 2^9, 2^10, 2^11, 2^12, 2^13, 2^14, 2^15.

There will be 4 Experiments:

- Randomly Generated Array with elements ranging from 0 to 1000 (ints). -> Average time and comparisons for each Algo.
- Sorted Array.
- Inversely Sorted Array.
- Array with elements being only 1, 2 and 3.

## Structure

- **src** directory stores all the source code(Algorithms, testing code, analisys code and Matplotlib plot code).
- **data** has all the json output data of the experiment.
- **img** has all the Matplotlib plot images.
- **docs** has a complete Analisys document, written in Ukrainian.

## Usage

Clone it and run the source files from **src** directory!

! **test_algos.py** runs about 20-25 minutes - you will see the progress.

If you want to change something, the code documentation should be enough to exaplain everything.
